potato.vim
==========

The colors for iTerm2 are provided, and one day I'll do up some Xdefaults too.

If you [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) then add this to your .vimrc:

    Bundle 'jarednorman/vim-potato'
    colo potato

If you [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or something else, figure it out.
