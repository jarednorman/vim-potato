potato.vim
==========

This is just a nice looking colorscheme.

## Installation

If you [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) then add this to your .vimrc:

    Bundle 'jarednorman/vim-potato'

If you [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or something else, figure it out.

## Vim colorscheme

To use the colorscheme in Vim, just add `colo potato` to your `.vimrc`.

## [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)

A vim-airline theme is included. Add `let g:airline_theme='potato'` to your `.vimrc`.

## Terminal Colours

The colours for iTerm2 are provided, and one day I'll do up some Xdefaults too.
